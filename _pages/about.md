Welcome to my personal site!

About Me
======
I am Xinyue Song! I received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics from [Hainan University](https://www.hainanu.edu.cn/), Haikou, China, in 2021. I am currently working toward the M.S. degree in applied mathematics with the School of Mathematics (Zhuhai), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), Zhuhai, China under the supervision of [Prof.Dongyang Kuang](https://dykuang.github.io/). My research interests include deep learning, computational neuroscience, neural decoding of brain-machine interfaces, data analytics and explainable AI.


Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 


**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
