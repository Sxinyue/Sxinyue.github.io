I am Xinyue Song! I received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics from [Hainan University](https://www.hainanu.edu.cn/), Haikou, China, in 2021. I am currently working toward the M.S. degree in applied mathematics with the School of Mathematics (Zhuhai), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), Zhuhai, China under the supervision of [Prof.Dongyang Kuang](https://dykuang.github.io/). My research interests include deep learning, computational neuroscience, neural decoding of brain-machine interfaces, data analytics and explainable AI.
