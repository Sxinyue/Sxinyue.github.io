This is a small code for emotion experiments. During this procedure, you can record participant's basic information and their emotional state to csv file. I delete the video folder for some reasons. You can add any films to begin your experiments![Code](https://github.com/Sxinyue/movie-stim/blob/main/test_1.py)
